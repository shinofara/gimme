    database, we can't do that. Aside from that, our app never acts on
    behalf of the user when the user isn't there, so it's not actually
    offline.

    redirect to the home screen, which will trigger the OAuth flow
    again and log the user back in with a new token. Since the user has
    already given consent, they won't actually have to do anything,
    they'll just find themselves back on the home page.
